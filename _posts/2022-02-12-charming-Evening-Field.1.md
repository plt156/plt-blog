Candle marches have been a part of various social, political and religious movements. It is a way for people to come together and protest against something or pray for a cause. The soft light of the candles can be seen as a symbol of hope and positivity in the face of darkness.

Many people believe that candles have a big role to play in prayer and meditation. The Jains, for example, believe that candles contain cells, giving them a spiritual significance.

However, while candles can uplift our moods, they cannot provide heat. If you live in a cold country and need to generate heat, it is better to use a campfire instead of candles.

The use of candles in candle marches, mass prayers or as a way to remember the departed, has a profound emotional impact. It serves as a reminder that we are not alone and that there is hope even in the darkest of times.

So, if you're looking to participate in a candle march or simply use candles as a way to lift your mood, remember to always use them safely and follow the rules to avoid any accidents.
