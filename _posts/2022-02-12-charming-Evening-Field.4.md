The candle making industry has been a big hit in the West, where it is a $2 billion business. However, in India, the scenario was not the same. The influence of Christianity, where candles play a big role, is not as dominant in India. But the trend is changing and India is adapting to this new trend, especially among the youth. They understand the importance of mental health and how candles can uplift their mood, which is why the candle making business is becoming increasingly popular in India. With more and more people starting their business from home and candles being a great gift option, the future of candle making in India is looking bright.
