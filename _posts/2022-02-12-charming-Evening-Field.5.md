The idea of converting soap into a candle might seem appealing, but it's not possible. Although soaps might look similar to candles, they are made of different materials. On the other hand, cosmetics like lotions and balms contain a percentage of wax, including soy wax which is skin safe, and beeswax, which is commonly used in cosmetics. The wax in cosmetics makes the texture similar to candles, but it's not possible to convert soap into a candle. In conclusion, candles and soaps are two completely different products, and one cannot be converted into the other.
