Candles have been a popular way to add fragrance and ambiance to a home for centuries. In recent years, there has been an influx of new fragrance options available, including the popular scents of lavender, sage, and lotus. In this blog, we will explore the benefits of these fragrances and discuss the various options available for incorporating them into your home.

Sage and lotus are two fragrances that have been known for their calming effects. Sage is often used as an antidepressant fragrance, while lotus is a relaxing and peaceful scent. These fragrances are believed to help uplift the mood, making them great choices for meditation, relaxation, and stress relief.

Fragrance preference is a very personal issue, and what might seem like an antidepressant fragrance to one person might not seem like an antidepressant fragrance to another. When choosing a fragrance for your home, it's important to find what works best for you. You may want to try different fragrances and see how they affect you and your mood.

There is also a new entrant in the market â€“ LED candles. While these candles provide the same ambiance as traditional candles, they do not have any fragrance. If you're looking to incorporate the benefits of candles into your home, it's important to consider this when choosing between LED candles and traditional candles. Traditional candles not only offer fragrance but also the benefits of relaxation and upliftment that are associated with burning candles.

When using candles in your home, it's important to always follow safety guidelines. Place the candle on a flat surface, light it in sight, and never leave it burning unattended. It's also recommended to not burn a candle for more than four hours at a time and to extinguish it and allow the wax to cool before trimming it to 1/4 of an inch before relighting.

In conclusion, fragrance preference is a personal matter, and there are a variety of options available for incorporating fragrance into your home. Whether you choose sage, lotus, or another fragrance, the benefits of candles go beyond just the scent. They offer a calming and relaxing atmosphere that can uplift the mood and promote relaxation. Just remember to always follow safety guidelines and enjoy the benefits of incorporating candles into your home.
