Yes. It's about the neurotransmitter sending messages to the brain after we smell something. So yes we can.

Candles can be used for anti-depressing activities because they have a calming effect on us when we smell them.

The best candles for treating depression are fragrances like eucalyptus, peppermint and sage. Rosemary might help with the anti-anxiety and anti-depressing effects.

What do you think about chamomile? Chamomile is again very calming and that's a night fragrance so that could help us sleep better at night.
