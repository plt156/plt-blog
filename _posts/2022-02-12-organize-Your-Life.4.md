Hey, candle fanatics!

If you love candles and want to keep your home as beautiful as possible, these tips will help you get started.

First thing's first: how many hours should your candle burn? The answer is… well, it depends on the type of wax you're using. 100% soy wax candles are the best choice for home use because they don't have any carcinogenic chemicals or other toxins that could cause harm if they got into your air or your food supply (although the FDA hasn't tested them yet).

If you're using a paraffin wax candle outdoors, you'll want to make sure it doesn't drip on anything and that it's not being used near babies or pets—especially small pets like rats or mice. For these reasons, it's best to always keep paraffin candles away from children and animals when possible.

Once your wax has cooled down completely, trim it so that the black residue around the wick is gone before lighting up again. If you notice any kind of brownish discoloration around the edge of your candle afterwards.

Candles are a beautiful, easy way to add ambiance to any room. Whether you're lighting your own candle or buying one from the store, it's important to know how long your candle will burn for and what kind of wax you should use.

### Here are some tips for maintaining your candles:

-Don't leave a burning candle unattended—especially around pets and children.

-Place your candle on a flat surface rather than an object that it might topple upon.

-Always place your candle on a flat surface or light it and always light it. (If you don't have time to do this, use an electric burner.)

-Burning time is limited by the amount of wax that is melted in each candle, so be sure not to overheat them! You can check for coolness by blowing on the bottom of the jar; if there's no resistance at all, then it's ready for another round of melts.

-The black residue that forms around the wick is called "scum" and should be trimmed off before burning again.

-Burning candles in your home is always going to be more dangerous than burning them out in the yard or outside on a deck because people tend not to keep their eyes on them as much when they're indoors—and that means accidents can happen easier! So please make sure that no one ever gets near your candles while they're lit because if something happens, it could cause serious harm or even death!

## "Tips for Proper Candle Maintenance: Keep Your Candle Safe and Long-lasting

Candles are a great way to add warmth, ambiance, and fragrance to your home. However, improper care and maintenance of your candle can lead to reduced burn time, uneven wax distribution, and even potential fire hazards. Here are some tips to help you properly maintain your candles, ensuring a safe and long-lasting experience.

### Burn Time

A minimum burn time for a candle should be around 15 minutes. This allows the wax to melt evenly, creating an even pool of wax around the wick. It's important to never leave a candle unattended and to never burn a candle for more than four hours at a time. After four hours, it's recommended to extinguish the candle and let it cool down before trimming the wick to 1/4 inch and lighting it again.

### Wax Distribution

To prevent uneven wax distribution, make sure to place your candle on a flat surface, away from any objects that might cause it to topple over. The wax pool should never be allowed to touch the sides of the container, as this can cause the glass to overheat and crack. Keep an eye on the wax pool as it burns and extinguish the candle if it starts to get too close to the sides.

### Total Burn Time

The total burn time of a candle can vary greatly depending on the type of candle and the size of the jar. For example, a small birthday candle may only burn for a few hours, while a large jar candle, such as an Amber Jar candle, could burn for up to 60 hours.

### The Burn Ask

Always follow the rules and be safe around candles, especially if you have pets and babies at home. Place your candle on a flat surface and make sure it is lit in a well-ventilated area. Never leave a burning candle unattended and make sure to extinguish it after four hours of use.

### Choosing the Right Wax

If you're using candles in your home, it's important to choose the right type of wax. For safety, it's best to choose 100% soy wax candles, as they burn clean and do not emit any harmful carbon soot. Paraffin waxes are often used for outdoor candles where people are not close to the flame, but it's not recommended for use in enclosed spaces.

In conclusion, proper candle maintenance is essential for a safe and long-lasting candle experience. Always make sure to follow the recommended burn time, choose the right type of wax, and follow proper safety precautions when using candles in your home. With these tips, you can enjoy the warm glow and fragrance of candles for many hours to come."
