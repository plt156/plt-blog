Hey there!

So, today we're going to be talking about how to induce sleep. I've seen candles and sleep have a connection. Basically everything has a connection with fragrance, so whenever we smell something nice, it uplifts some mood, so we can use a candle to trigger a lot of emotions depending on the essential oils used.

I would suggest using a lavender essential oil, which has a very calming and soothing effect on us. Um, probably use a lavender bath salt that we make and then lighter lavender candle and tuck yourself in bed and have a good night's sleep. Yeah, I think you're right because I've seen sometimes when I smell bad it triggers a nausea type of sense that there are scientific studies that have proven how our brain reacts to certain fragrances and smells. So yes, definitely lighting a good fragrant scandal will uplift your mood.

So is there any particular fragrance or flavorâ€”sage? Lavender? What do you have in mind that is specific that will help people in getting or inducing sleep? Like I said, Lavender will help a lot.

And we don't want to trigger too many emotions late night just before bed time.
